# SOC-Home-Lab

so i've been interested in doing some in depth research about SOC tools (works really just put me on standby without any prior knowledge of tools, whereas everytime i see a job post it will always be like "familiarity with SIEM such as [you name it]" kind of thing), i want to really grasp the understanding of (most) tools i used at work (and don't used), mostly all the software will be free (yes, i'm broke) and this is somekind of the documentation repo for it

# Devices
i'm using my own laptop for this, i think it will be enough for some small home SOC lab, althought i have the specs as this
- AMD Ryzen 5 4600H | 6 Core 12 Thread | 3 GHz - 4 GHz
- 16GB Ram
- 1,5TB Storage (Seperated into 2 500GB and 1TB NVME)
- NVIDIA GTX 1650ti GPU

i personally think its pretty decent, with another ram upgrade i could probably run more VMs (3 at most for now)

# Software Used
i will be using Oracle Virtual Box (it's less resource intensive imo), also who needs to run the terminal in the vm (with a laggy display, and who runs a server VM with display?? ofc me) when i could just SSH'ed my way in.

and i will be using CentOS stream 9, been thinking to put the master / security server in Ubuntu (or even arch. and i use arch as 2nd daily driver.. i use arch BTW), but let's see which perform better, later.. (my company uses CentOS, but they will soon migrate to something else, i can't really remember the name but it's a RHEL downstream)

# Closing
i think that's it?? well in case there's some updates, i think this will get an update, lets just wait and see.
