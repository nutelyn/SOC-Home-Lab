# Documentation
before i start, i just want to say that i don't usually make something like this, i just feel like to make one, so in any case of typo or offensive word or even some dumb fact, i deeply apologise if it affect you as the reader somehow.

## Note
actually to install wazuh it's pretty straight forward, just go to their documentation which could be found [here](https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/installation-guide/index.html), so open up a tab with their installation guide and just follow then from top to bottom

## Architecture
Wazuh actually has a rather interesting architecture, it consist of several part:
- Wazuh Indexer
- Wazuh Server
- Wazuh Dashboard
- Wazuh Agent

if you're a more visual reader, this might help ("Borrowed" directly form wazuh docs)
![wazuh architecture](https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/_images/deployment-architecture1.png)

what did they do? great question, here's a TL;DR for you
### Wazuh Indexer
basically their search analytical engine that index and stores alert which generated by the server which could be accessed in ALMOST REAL TIME.

### Wazuh Server
so what this part does is just analysze the data recieve from the agent(s) and triggering alerts, the server also form C&C with the agent(s)

### Wazuh Dashboard
visualise everything you need to see (a UI, WebUI)

## Pre-Installation
yes you read that right, PRE installation.\
Wazuh actually have 2 dependencies
- Java
- Opensearch

for the java version, you should refer to the [opensearch docs](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/install-and-configure/install-opensearch/index/) java compability and install whichever version you need although latest version will always work and compatible, if you have more than 1 java version make sure to follow the docs and specify the java version.
