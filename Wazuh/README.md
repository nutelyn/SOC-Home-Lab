# what is Wazuh?
Wazuh is an Open Source security platform, unifying XDR and SIEM for endpoint and cloud.

Wazuh support some features such as:
- Endpoint Security
- Threat Intelligence
- Security Operations
- Cloud Security

It's much more of a HIDS since it's actively monitoring our system and not the networks, capable of realtime dataflow ensuring continuos XDR protectio and SIEM solution.

in my company, wazuh is mainly used for thei XDR which then integrated with IBM Qradar.
